# Nischal's Version Control System  

This is a personal project where I built a simplified version of Git. The goal was to understand how a version control system works at a low level, including file tracking, commits, and branching. The features below represent the current progress of the project.  

---

## Goals  
- **Initializing function (`git init`)** – Complete  
- **File adding (`git add .`)** – Complete  
- **Committing (`git commit -m`)** – In progress  
- **Branching (`git checkout -b "name"`)** – In progress  
- **Reverting (`git revert`)** – In progress  

---

## Usage  
1. Download the code.  
2. Build the project by running:  
   make
3. Run the executable with ./mygit

## Dependencies

This project uses the dirent.h library, which means it only runs on POSIX-compliant systems such as macOS and Linux.\\


Thanks to the LazyVim team.  I love this new tech.
