# Nischal's Version Control System
This is a personal project, where I attempted to create a clone of git.  The requierements I set for myself are below. 



# Goals
1. Initialising function("git commit") : complete
2. File adding(git add .)              : complete
3. Commiting(git commit -m)            : In progress
4. Branching(git checkout -b "Name").  : In progress
5. Reverting(git revert)               : In progress


# Usage 
1. Download code
2. Build File
Run "make in the Terminal
3. Change Directory to your test folder
4. Run the mygit.exe file
# Dependencies
This VCS requieres dirent.h, which means that only POSIX compliant systems will support this software.  I was building this on a Macbook, so it was the best choice
